# StudyBot
A discord Bot custom build to increases the organizational efficiency of a University Club. The bot is a pretty crude experiment in learning a new programming language through an extremely big project; wouldn't recommend it. The goal was to solve an efficiency problem while also learning a new language. The bot is built with JS on top of NodeJS and DiscordJS, hosted on personal hardware (Raspberry Pi). The goal of hosting on personal hardware was to avoid using databases and their respectively inefficient APIs and utilize the simple principle of sharing data between system modules via the use of JSON files, simplifying the data flow of the program and reducing total network bandwidth by limiting all API calls to be only Discord Specific.
